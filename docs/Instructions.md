# Final project

As part of a small group (no more than 3 students), you will build a data science library or application using Python. Examples of potential projects include:

* a medical image-processing library
* a genetic analysis toolkit with command-line interface
* an HTTP API to biomedical knowledge graph data

## Logistics

Create a public or private GitHub repository and a README.md identifying the library or application name and the general software architecture. Generate a series of GitHub issues describing the main development tasks and assign the appropriate group member(s) according to your agreed-upon distribution of labor. Submit a link to the repository via Sakai for the "Final Project" assignment by April 10. The initial README and issues will constitute your "project plan". You will receive feedback by April 17 in case the project plan/scope needs adjustment.

The work performed by individual group members should be reflected by the commit authors - do not email code you wrote to another group member for them to commit.

Use pull requests to facilitate code review by group members. You may also request reviews from instructor(s) at any point prior to the project due date.

## Requirements

Your project should incorporate all of the good development practices that we have discussed:

### style consistency

Developers should not be confused or annoyed trying to read or search your code. Follow `pycodestyle` and use `black`.

### tests

You should have tests. There should be documentation about how to run the tests. The tests should pass. The tests should cover as much functionality and code as possible.

You're welcome to copy the GitHub workflow configuration from our EHR project.

### documentation

Newcomers should be able to run your library/application without assistance. I strongly recommend that you test this out by sending a friend the link to your repository.

## Submission

Submit a link to your repository on Sakai by the due date. Indicate who is working in your group.

## Evaluation notes

The scope of the project is expected to reflect the number of students in the group.

Projects will be evaluated based on the appropriate use of tools and development practices rather than any data science aspects. We prefer something simple done well than something complex done hastily.
